ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm a longtime Mac user and command line aficiando.

ðŸ”§ I use command line software, like PostgreSQL and Python, to manipulate and manage data.

ðŸ”§ I use GitHub to keep notes and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) publish them on a [website](https://postgresqlstan.github.io), making them easily accesible to me (and the rest of the world).

ðŸ—£ One of the advantages of storing notes in a GitHub repository is its use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) to convert plain text into formatted web pages like this one. (You can see the boring, unprocessed, plain text source for this page [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PostgreSqlStan/PostgreSqlStan/main/README.md).) Markdown has become my preferred format for most documents.

ðŸ‘€ You're not really interested in my hobbies or personal life, are you?

ðŸ”– I enjoy writing about technology and inevitably learn a lot in the process.
