ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a command line enthusiast who loves using postgres on macOS.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data wrangling (ETL) with postgres, python and other \*nix tools.

âœ… I've been using postgres for occasional data wrangling tasks for about two decades.

ðŸŒ± I still have so much to learn. (That's why I enjoy it.)
