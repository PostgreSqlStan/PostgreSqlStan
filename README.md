# 👋 Hi

💻 I'm a longtime Mac user and command line aficiando. (macOS is Unix.)

😮 I started programming with an Apple ][e in the early 1980s.

🔧 I wrangle data with basic Unix commands, shell scripts, PostgreSQL, Python, and other open source software.

✏️ I use git and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to keep and share notes about the software I use.

❤️ I enjoy writing about technology and inevitably learn a lot in the process.

☕️ You're not really interested in my hobbies or personal life, are you?

🔖 "So it goes."
