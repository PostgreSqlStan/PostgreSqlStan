ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @PostgreSqlStan, a command line interface enthusiast who loves using postgres on macOS.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very interested in data wrangling (ETL) with postgres and other command line tools.
âœ… I've been using postgres, on and off, for about two decades, butâ€¦
ðŸŒ± I still have a lot to learn.
