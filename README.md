👋 Hi. I'm a longtime Mac user and command line aficiando. 

🔧 I use GitHub to store notes about CLI tools I enjoy using, and use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to share them with the rest of the world.

>One of the advantages of storing notes in a GitHub repository is its use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) to convert plain text into formatted web pages like this one. (You can see the boring, unprocessed, plain text source for this page [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PostgreSqlStan/PostgreSqlStan/main/README.md).) Markdown has become my preferred format for most documents.

🔧 I've been using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for various data wrangling needs and personal database projects since the early 2000s. It has generally exceeded my expectations since the first time I used it. I'm a huge fan.

🔖 I enjoy writing about technology and inevitably learn a lot in the process. 

😑 Technology flame wars are boring. 

❤️ I love coffee.
