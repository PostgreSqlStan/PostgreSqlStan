ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @PostgreSqlStan, a command line interface enthusiast who loves using postgres on macOS.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very interested in data wrangling (ETL) with postgres, python and other \*nix tools.

âœ… I've been doing this stuff, on and off, for about two decades, butâ€¦

ðŸŒ± I still have so much to learn. (That's why I enjoy it.)
